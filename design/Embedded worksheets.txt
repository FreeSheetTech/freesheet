Embedded worksheets
===================

Aims
----

- Create a worksheet in any HTML page
- Embed a worksheet in a CK editor
- Edit the worksheet in place, save code along with page
- Edit a standalone worksheet and save as a document on site
- Import a worksheet
- See values of worksheet live while editing?
- See when editing but hide the worksheet when page viewed
- See the worksheet when page viewed for debugging
- Enter formulas in worksheet and save them with the page
- Link inputs on worksheet to elements/events on the page
- Link outputs of the worksheet to actions on the page
- Easily use worksheet outputs in template placeholders on the page
- Allow for reuse and import
- Allow for linking multiple worksheets
- Allow for testing

Thoughts
--------
- Running a Freesheet script in a page is different to having a worksheet
- The table is just a tool to help editing and debugging
- Include FS runtime to be able to run scripts
- Scripts included with script tags
- Include FS worksheet JS to be able to see a worksheet for any included script
- Worksheets may appear in page on load, or appear on demand, or pop up
- Can work in any HTML page
- Should also work inside a CKEditor
- Need to update the text in the script at a suitable point
- The worksheet is not saved in the HTML
- If script is loaded externally, need a protocol for updating the script - or not?
- Need to be able to insert scripts just by asking for a new worksheet - for less-techie users
- Worksheets may be hidden when page in use - so debugging could appear anywhere
- Worksheets may be intended to be visible, so want them at a particular place in the page
- May want to hide formula column
- Data worksheets are different
- Calculator sheets and connector sheets
- Connector sheets intended just to link calculator sheets to i/o
- Can you enforce this or is it just a convention?

Programming in the page
-----------------------
- Can show inline or src script as worksheet
- Can edit worksheet
- How save the worksheet - inline and separate file
- How make it clear to user they are editing a shared resource
- Can you edit a worksheet on its own outside a page?

Pages
-----
- Every page is a web component
- Every page can be shown standalone
- Can be embedded in others and get its own data
- Can make its data available to the page
- Can be embedded just for its data, without UI
- Web pages can have places for content where other things can be embedded
- Some pages may exist just as templates - embed them in a page and fill them in
- Components in page can have attrs set from values of other components
- Each component advertises its values under compname.valuename
- List components could advertise current selection, which controls another comp to display it's details
