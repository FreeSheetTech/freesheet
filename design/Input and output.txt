Input and output mechanism
==========================

- Need to link to sources, like another module's outputs
- Need to be able to put an input into a worksheet and see the result
- Need to be able to see all the inputs that have happened and the output events created
- Mark values as output values to save history, whereas others just have current value?
- See output event history
- May have an input validation module that works on page inputs and sends events to core module (like old batch systems)
- Will need to snapshot state of some inputs when an event occurs eg submit clicked
- Linked with testing
- Linked with event history
- Runner has history besides current state
- Rewind and step through would be good

Runner
------
- Could provide named streams to it in same way as add user functions
- Could save everything that comes in on each input in a list
- Also need a merged list of all inputs
- Timings on each input needed for some things
- Outputs also need to be saved in a list
- Link outputs to the input event that caused them
- Rewind - would need to replay to that point
- Could change inputs if rewind, play to change, do change, continue
- May need different schedulers where timing effects involved
- OR could make it client's responsibility to save events
- OR make it another layer around the runner - keep runner simpler, separate concerns
- BUT then runner can't calc a new function added BUT is this really needed in core runner?


Worksheet
---------
- Need a way to add an input
- Need a way to view inputs
- Need a way to rewind or replay inputs
- Need a way to view outputs
- Also useful to view history of non-output streams for debugging
- Poss: tables to left for input and right for output, with scrolling, same rows as worksheet


Testing
-------
- Give a merged sequence of input events
- OR a set of separate input event sequences with relative timing
- Give an expected sequence of output events
- Save canned sequences of input events and pull in
- Timings on input events, relative to previous
