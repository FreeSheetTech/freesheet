Use Cases
=========

Revision quiz
-------------

- How use worksheets to do a simple daily revision quiz, or a more complex SRS type
- Need to access a web service and/or local storage data
- Need to select words to show
- Need to do something with each word
- Need to do things with all the words - eg total answered, correct
- Need to record results
- Need to update the database via web service or local storage

Invoice with line items
-----------------------

- Invoice has Account No, Date, Delivery address, Default Tax rate, line item list
- Line item has description, units, unit price, optional tax rate
- Want to show for each line item: input data and price, tax, total
- Want to show for invoice: input data, no of items, item total, tax total, invoice total

Standalone web page
-------------------
- Hosted on any website eg S3, Dropbox
- Edited in IDE
- Source in Github
- Freesheet scripts are part of the source like HTML, JS, CSS
- Script has inputs from page elements
- Script updates page elements
- Show worksheet in page for debugging
- Show worksheet in page for editing and updating
- Worksheet hidden/not created in normal mode
- Worksheet events on definition change so can do something to save the change
- To share files, need to have standard js and files on a CDN
- Makes testing with localhost during dev more difficult but prob a way round this

Desktop document
----------------
- Data saved with document
- Open file loads data with it
- Copy without data to create empty document - template


How would you do...
-------------------
- A space invaders game
- A sequence of pages in an adventure game
- An accounting system
- A SRS system

How can it be easy to...
------------------------
- Set up calculations in a page
- Retrieve data from a web service or another page, and see it for debugging
- Define data in a page - in a similar way to calculations?
- Re-use data and/or calculation worksheets in other pages
- Represent multi-level nested data structures
- Keep a unified view of data and calculated data
- Link page controls to calculations as inputs
- Use calculated data in text
- Use calculated data in other elements
- Preview the page in action while working on it
- Easily blend in own JavaScript by just loading/referencing files
- Manage dependencies and versions

Use cases
---------
- Standalone calculation and understanding engine eg pricing
- Run a worksheet as a server side API
- Database read and update
- Transparent data access
- Data held in worksheets - esp reference data
- Other web service access and filtering
- Programmer uses to generate JS and use in another program
- End user customises an application
- Embedded rules eg posting wizards in accounting system
- ETL
- Daemon that can be set up with rules and accept input messages, pub/sub outputs
- Public service like lambda
- View what going on in daemon as a worksheet
- Easily load worksheet into cloud service
- Microservice alternative - separate processes or various worksheets in one process with streams connecting
- Page with embedded worksheet
- Page with HTML generated on server with embedded worksheet
- Page which runs on either server or client depending on what needed
- Desktop app like spreadsheet app
- Desktop app that produces active documents - PDF?
- Handy calculator page eg for diet - could also do lookups
- Tool for processing text inputs
- Add own JS/CS functions, lodash available, store with worksheet - trusted cases only
- Modular application with many scripts referencing each other
- Accounting system with some fixed parts and some user-modifiable parts
- User-modifiable worksheets and application worksheets
- Web app - each function is an endpoint - one sheet instance per request
- Web app - each function is an endpoint - one sheet instance with stored inputs for all requests, saving state
- Worksheets where only formulas can be changed
- Runtime Environments: server/node, web page, standalone
- Programming environments: IDE, browser, standalone
- Sheets with one main answer for writing utilities and scripts
- Command line runner can take script file, parse args to inputs, output one or more values eg one called 'main' or specify
- Chat server
- Server side sheet for test with hidden data

How people could make use of it
-------------------------------
- Create a local worksheet with included data storage for use with own data
- Create a local web page with embedded worksheet and included data storage as a local document for use with own data
- Create a page on a website with embedded worksheet  for other people to access - no data
- Create a page on a website with embedded worksheet  for other people to access with - shared persistent data
- Create a page on a website with embedded worksheet  for other people to access with - individual persistent data
- Create a server side worksheet with persistent data

Who might use it
----------------
- Non-techies who want a calculation
- Non-techies who want a local app for their own use
- Non-techies who want to publish a web page
- Techies who can write HTML
- Techies who can manage their own website
- Techies making a server-based app

Really simple user experience
-----------------------------

- Go to website
- See blank page with web page section and worksheet
- OR see getting started examples
- Instructions and reference beside the working page
- Edit worksheet and web page
- See results immediately
- Click buttons etc and use page live
- Store inputs in an element within the page
- Save whole page content to disk
- Save whole page content to Drive

SRS system
----------------
- Model Inputs:
   - fact to learn - stored
   - attempt - stored
   - repetition config - stored but only most recent needed
   - time - immediate
- Model outputs:
  - facts to attempt now

- UI outputs:
  - facts to attempt now
- UI inputs:
  -  text input related to fact -> attempt
