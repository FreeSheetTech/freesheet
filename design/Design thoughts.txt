Design thoughts
===============

As a learner or teacher building pages, non-technical but computer-literate,
I want an easy way of calculating values to use in the page

(Original) Requirements
------------
- Easily create a table to be used as a hidden worksheet
- Use a visible table as a worksheet
- Cells can contain formulas, including literal values
- Formulas resemble Excel formulas
- Functions in formulas should be easy to add - just JavaScript functions added to certain object? or global?
- Calculated cell values update named values that can be used in other formulas
- Named values can be used in Spacebars template fields anywhere on the page
- Calculations update automatically
- Formulas can bring in values from outside worksheet with functions
- Outside functions should include input values and time


Thoughts
--------
- Outputs: very useful to separate from private intermediate result expressions for (a) maintainability (b) uncluttered result to use elsewhere (c) testing
- Separate outputs by naming convention or declaration
- Output may be single value or sequence or aggregation - but there is only *one* per function - or is there?
- Multiple outputs: should we allow multiple named outputs as a shorthand for/alternative to an output map?
- Multiple outputs: what people expect in a worksheet
- Multiple outputs: they may not all change at once, could be separate streams
- Defining named functions then combining them again into an output that just repeated the names would be confusing and non-DRY
- Should you have reusable functions with just one output and worksheet object with multiple values?
- Unified view: functions can have several named outputs, and internal functions, so overall program is one outer function with several named outputs
- Named values are defined as functions, anyway
- Maybe worksheets are more like namespaces, and functions are just at top-level, and are different
- Maybe only top-level named outputs become separate streams - nowhere to refer to them as an aggregate anyway
- Need to wire outputs into actions somehow, as well as just tracking and displaying
- Maybe output event streams - which is what they are?
- Output effects: call a function which has a side effect and may return a value
- Output values: may be complex with much info about the output, generally all info that went in eg ajax url and payload
- Testing outputs: really need to turn off side effects and check the returned value against expected
- Output examples: play sound, make ajax call, change page, get/set local storage
- Testing with mocks: could be necessary, substitute other functions called with mocks
- Stubbing syntax: just list of functions to stub
- Connector block worksheets could help to wire reused functions to a particular page
- A worksheet is a function mapping a set of input event sequences to a set of outputs
- Or maybe a single sequence of input event combinations to a single sequence of output event combinations
- Actually a function mapping these things plus a sequence of formula settings to outputs, but more useful to assume those all there
- Connects up with the idea of state being the history of an object
- Current value is init state with every update folded in
- May need to snapshot state at intervals - manual or auto, each year or after every update?
- Which connects up with setting up test data by performing sequence of operations on the system
- Need to be able to use functions as first class objects - it is FP, after all
- Do functions have to be defined separately or can they be nested within another sheet?
- How do things like filtering on input or adding a value to a column
- Should every worksheet have defined inputs and outputs, and input sources have to be wired in separately?  How define? How wire?
- Or should this be optional - reusability vs convenience?
- Should functions be allowed to pick up external values directly within formulas as well as their defined inputs - a bit like implicits
- Worksheets are functions mapping zero or more event sequences to at least one output event sequence
- If no aggregation over the input streams, always use latest value from inputs, could be equivalent to function mapping set of values to outputs
- Easier if regard all functions as taking streams, even if the stream just has a single value in it
- Values of input and output streams can be any simple or complex type
- Sets of named inputs and outputs naturally form maps
- Functions can be applied to and can return any simple or complex type
- A function is defined by a named worksheet and can then be referenced in formulas
- A function from one simple value to another might be cumbersome to define as a worksheet
- Need syntax to define inputs that must be provided
- Functions used in foreach expressions - do they take stream of input values, and can they do aggregation as they go?
- Definition and instance separation - named worksheets at top level like objects, what about when used in formulas in many places
- How to implement reuse in different places
- How to show reuse to user on work page
- Changes in outputs due to changes in inputs are just new outputs in the stream due to new events in the input stream(s)
- Data at rest needs to be converted to and from streams to go through functions
- A data worksheet is just a function with no inputs that produces a stream with one output value
- Output events can be connected to widget actions in some way - or just raise DOM events to link back into jQuery
- Should be easy to drop back into jQuery
- Output events will often be when a button and another stream happen together
- Built-in action widgets to control browser eg go to page
- May want worksheets to be visible as quick UI - or hide the formula columns
- Data load should just be a function that returns an input stream, single complex value, include anywhere
- May want to include function results as top-level definitions on the page - could just be named worksheet with one unnamed row
- Re-use worksheet functions from any other page - just has to be a parseable table
- Or keep worksheets in script form
- Could publish pages of library functions - just put documentation and examples on the page with them
- Consider saving all inputs in dev mode to replay when a formula changes
- Maybe all function streams should have distinct on them
- Testing facilities important - eg table with input event rows at top and output events below, with columns at particular times
- Must be easy to think *how* to test
- Maybe record events and times to create the table
- To test like this the inputs need to be explicitly named - another advantage
- Could have functions that emit events over a period eg a sine wave for animation physics
- 'Wire up' a worksheet by calling it as a function in another sheet and passing in input streams created by calling functions that create streams from environment
- Need to unify functions, fixed datasheets and simple values and be able to substitute one for another
- Function inputs specified differently to outputs
- A function actually just has one output - may have several parts - may be an aggregate expressions
- Calling a function (at least one with no args) should be substitutable for specifying it inline
- A function with no inputs and just an output should look the same as a data value
- A worksheet at top level of page with no inputs looks like a data value, but may still have formulas
- Instantiation: top-level worksheets with no inputs will normally be objects on the page
- Functions: how distinguish functions with no inputs from top-level value objects
- Functions with no inputs can still reference implicit inputs, such as form fields or data retrieval - at least in a "connector" sheet
- Function call in a cell may expand to a big multi-level table
- In tables, a function with no inputs and just a simple output is represented by a single formula cell and its value
- More flexible with values in the same cell as formula, like Excel, with styling to show one or other or both - could easily use CSS to look like two cells
- Can use monitor table as simple display, fixed values don't look silly, more like Excel, can show formula in many different ways
- One value, one cell, but may expand
- At page level, named tables are like top-level defs - may be just a single cell with a fixed value or a single function call
- How does this fit with templating like Blaze - just independent?
- May need to choose how/which worksheet values are transmitted to other template mechanisms
- So if you have a worksheet like the sheet1 price calculator, that is a no inputs function with a map output - or is it a group of separate named outputs?
- Inputs to functions - are they a list, a list of names or a map?
- May be useful to tailor the auto-display of a function, to hide/format certain values, but also may be best to treat as just a debugging aid
- Toggle display button - framework could make any element with a certain class be a toggle
- Table with 1/2 columns indicates list or map
- How distinguish single value/list of 1, and null/empty list - do you need to?
- Liveness - edit in page in both edit and display mode
- Page with final user-editable formulas
- Event history stored and can be displayed to help debugging
- Compare xslt fp and sequence usage
- Functions can return functions
- To store program just store original source or Json representation
- Can email source to people and they can cut and paste it elsewhere
- Templating: just edit page wysiwyg and put tags in, including repeat tags
- Parse to tree and construct stream net after
- Generate Js to create stream net
- Sep parts of formula and show in separate spans so can highlight
- Expand to formula above
- Can show values of any expr not just named values
- Syntax - keep like Excel and have = before every formula, text taken as string literal OR JS-like syntax with quoted strings
- If outputs of a function are just named values, have to 'wire them up' with another function
- App - just a bundle of functions, of which you can run one main one, possibly more?
- Running a function isn't a one off thing - it sits there continually waiting for input
- You don't really run a function - you start it
- Use as part of another program
- Transform streams back to values and use as synchronous callable function in a conventional program
- Use as a scripting language
- Continuous pipeline command processor
- Function params auto taken from CLI arguments
- Return kind - can we just say everything takes and returns streams, and if provide a built-in that uses plain values, need to wrap it before adding?
- Arg list - some functions need to take values as args, not streams eg for use in combineLatest
- Can UserFunctions always use streams, built-in need to specify?
- Can we/should we call no-arg functions without brackets - optional or not?
- Recursive functions: allowed? how handle them?
- May want a non-reactive implementation of all functions
- May want a non-reactive implementation of functions that are only used within other reactive functions BUT lose the debugging
- You really need user testing to know if real non-technical users will find this easy
- Embedding: being able to add built-in functions to script your app is a big win
- Smart Subject for web service result that uses cache headers to know whether to re-request each time it is asked
- Live tutorial that gets you to type in expressions and see result, and saves your answers to review
- Sandboxed - when used as embedded scripting language, can run only the provided functions, so no danger, like with Groovy
- Specification language: process AST to translate into English-like description, or graphical form
- Rules engine - way for users to change business rules in a system
- Emphasises steady values (signal) over changes (event) - different to most FRP systems

Sequences and objects
---------------------
- Need notation to refer to elements of maps and lists in basic formula syntax
- Some list operators need static lists eg sorting may need IxJS
- Dot operator creates a stream with pluck for one item
- Need object expressions
- Should use a function instead of special brackets eg LIST(a, 10, d * 4) and GROUP(a: 10, b: d * 4) - special syntax - more familiar
- Need to filter as well as transform
- BUT for simple case, non-reusable, can you just refer to the input value by name?
- Sequences automatically have expression applied to every element
- As all functions have stream inputs and outputs, if you apply it to a single value, get a single value, to stream you get a stream
- BUT need to be have aggregate expressions applied to the whole list
- Danger - if have stream that supplies a list for each value, what are you iterating over/aggregating on
- If want a short name, just define it!
- For dealing with lists (repeating data groups), need a foreach mechanism as well as aggregation
- Lists can be treated similarly to streams in some ways - many operations apply to both
- Functions applied to lists may be simpler than or different to those applied to sets of streams
  - only one input stream and one output stream
- Can list functions/expressions still pick up other values like inputs or times?
- Poss: No foreach - just a function with a single stream input that produces another stream, and may select, transform or aggregate each input event value
- Could use stream functions for streams and sequences, but say which you are doing?


Transform functions for sequences and objects
---------------------------------------------
- Easily pass through individual parts or all input values so can add properties
- Need to apply object expression to an input
- Input is the current scope of the expression
- Need a way to refer to this OR to name it in the expression
- Where need to pass a function to another, it could be just an expr with a special var to mean 'the target item' - maybe 'it'
- Must work for an 'add one' case as well as transforming a data structure

Local values within expressions
-------------------------------
- Or local functions
- Syntax is an issue
- Implementation is an issue
- Poss syntax:
  - _items in aggregation are ignored - but what if result is not an aggregation
  - nested name = expr definitions within an expr that is surrounded by delimiters - maybe round brackets
- Expressions used as transform functions will also have local values

Input functions that take expressions to identify the item
----------------------------------------------------------
- Does it help to look at these as being a map containing a collection of named inputs to the functions
- In word quiz example, page inputs can't be set up as separate streams because don't even know what they are until runtime, because generated from same expr that uses them
- So have to regard page inputs as a single stream with named elements
- Or regard page inputs as a function - everything can be a function
- Individual page inputs may not be there when ask for them - eg if generated by outputs of function
- The input function is actually a stream of functions that has to yield a new function whenever any of the inputs change
- And it is a stream of functions with arguments - don't have those yet for user functions, but need them

Code generator
--------------
- Recursive expansion of AST elements
- Function calls get stored as they are encountered
- Need to recreate precedence of bracketed expressions as they are lost in parsing

Time
----
- now() function represents current time
- now() has to be a stream that updates so that formulas that use it update
- if it changed every millisecond, would be too much computation
- now() updates every second
- Later: have different resolutions of now() eg now(100) to update every 100 ms


Programming environment
-----------------------

- Can run any function loaded
- Can run any expression
- Auto ask for arguments if run function with args
- Auto find implicit inputs requested by input functions
- Show evaluation sequences as input event streams and output values in columns with one event per line - vertical marble diagrams
- Recording debugging shows state after each event
- Testing uses exactly the same format
- Save incorrect run as test
- Can edit events at any point in stream and have the run re-evaluated
- Edit expected values on output side when it is a test
- BUT can also suppress the recording and just have the latest
- Where only interested in sets of events, may have all input events on one line
- Take care in order of events across line just in case a bug causes it to matter
- Influence - expression evaluation in debugging functional programs
- Error eg type mismatch results in Error, display message in cell
- Can use own styling in an HTML worksheet table eg for comments/headings
- Separate streams might lead to better debugging, but maybe better to use tools to evaluate highlighted exprs on the fly
- Can add any expression to worksheet at any time, so can have a tool where highlight an expr and it shows value in a popup
- Can add own JS/CS functions
- Click/hover to see documentation for functions/parameters
- Choose from functions available
- Worksheet tool needs AST to give help and debugging tools

Named values
------------
- Can subscribe multiple times to a named value
- Each subscription gets the current value (even if null) then changes
- New subscriptions do not get a replay of all values
- The named value can be reassigned to a new formula
- The initial value of the new formula (or null) is sent to subscriptions

Connection to page
------------------
- Init engine by adding built-in functions, including "input grabbers"
- On load, read worksheet and add named formulas
- Link outputs to page by setting their values in a ReactiveDict
- Link references in page via val helper, or via hook into lookup
- Show undefined formulas in worksheet on page

Worksheets
----------
- For large arrays of objects, show as table if seem to have "similar" keys in each object
- Display headings and 2-3 rows, with expansion options to see all, maybe paginated
- Inputs defined at top of worksheet, can enter values for testing in col 2
- Good to keep worksheet similar to text: preserve blank lines and comments, but formulas may span several lines and parser ignores them

Issues
------
- Should inputs be explicit or just allowed anywhere in worksheet?
- Should outputs be explicit or just have any named value be an output?
- Input functions are different because they transform non-cell/stream objects, or nothing, to cells/streams
- Internal functions always act on cell/stream and produce cell/stream



Reusing functions
-----------------

- Create separate worksheet
- Name the worksheet
- Define expected inputs with names - even if just one
- Maybe just put 'input' instead of a formula
- Use it in a formula with the normal function call syntax
- Need to copy the structure to each place it is used?
- If do that, how can you modify it in place?
- Possible: decouple each copy from its usage so that a new one can be wired in - aggregates would be wrong
- Is there a way of sharing one instance with different streams?
- If it had no aggregate functions, could just treat it as a single-value function and many streams could share
  - might be an optimisation for simple value transforms like date formatters
- Can ask the function for an instantiation of itself - if that is the same or different every time, doesn't matter
- The function is responsible for updating its current instantiations if its definition changes
- In user workbook, how know which input and output values to show on the display?
- If only one usage, can show that one
- If click on a formula that uses the function, show instance for that function
- Import just by calling an import function and giving it a name - named values can also be functions
- Functions may load dependencies transitively
- If all worksheets are pure and effects have to be explicitly connected, makes it safer to reuse others' worksheets
- If all worksheets are pure, they will be far easier to re-use
- If users can create impure worksheets, they won't be bothered to clean them up for reuse
- Testing much easier with pure worksheets

Transform and aggregation functions
-----------------------------------
- Transform is sequence -> sequence
- Aggregation is sequence -> value
- Both may apply either to a stream or to sequence values delivered by a stream
- In many cases obvious which you want, in others not
- FRP map + function is elided by this language
-
- Users want to use same functions
- Function providers want to reuse them
- Possible approaches:
  - Try to guess according to way it is used
  - Automatically generate two different function names
  - Assume apply to sequence value, use a modifier like foreach to apply to the stream
  - Assume apply to the stream, use a modifier like valueOf to apply to individual values
- Normal assumption is that functions apply to values
- Applying across stream values is an extension to spreadsheet paradigm so should be different
- Have a function like 'itemsOf' to mean 'treat as a stream, not individual values'
  - eg count(questions) vs count(itemsof(questions))
- How use same function to do running total of stream values and all values of a sequence?
- Stream from sequence ends, but asynchronous.  Use special scheduler?
- Can we write all functions in stream style and have them automatically applied to sequences by framework?
- How know which code to generate?
- Transform functions - can also be applied to stream or sequence
  - eg select(itemsof(answers), it > 5)
- Does this mean a change from functions being stream functions to just being sequence functions applied to stream or sequence?
- Any way to make itemsOf automatically present something different to the caller?
- Pros of different function names:
  - fewer parentheses
  - clearer that you have two functions for different purposes
  - only certain functions can be applied to sequences
  - obvious which are stream functions
  - if multiple arguments, all need to be stream or value, so would need multiple itemsOf and would need to be the same
  - some functions may be stream only or sequence only
- SO - don't change anything right now

Managing subscriptions and user functions
-----------------------------------------
- Need to handle non-existent user functions named in other functions - show error value - instead of null used now
- Need to clean up subscriptions when a user function is redefined
- Need to clean up subscriptions when a user function is removed
- Need to handle removing a user function after it has been referenced and subscribed to in other user functions
- Maybe no direct subscriptions - do everything through a broker (allChanges?) that gives error if no subject defined
- Code generator has to save all streams it creates and have a means to dispose them all
  - does disposing the final stream returned do that?
- Code generator knows all the functions it has used and returns them, so can find out if a named function used
- If introduce error value into user function subject if not defined when referenced, or removed, can propagate that
- Can use hasObservers and dispose on Rx.Subject
- If remove a user function used in other functions, then same situation as if it was used in a function before it is defined - send null or error
- Need to handle situation where user function is removed, but subject kept because used in another function, then that removed - need to clean up first one
- Changes: good if only had one change per function per input eg total depends on a and b, b depends on a, a changes, total emits two changes
- Does the set of observers need to change depending on the current values of the expr - or does Rx take care of that?

Error handling
--------------
- Syntax errors in parsing:
    - catch exception in TextLoader
    - Cannot get event from Runner because don't have function definition
    - Remove name from runner - which will send value change to null if it was there
    - TextLoader trigger onFunctionChange with error
    - TextLoader also passes on function changes from runner, decorated with beforeName
    - store bad text in TextLoader
    - save bad text in text file
    - handle invalid syntax while loading from text file

- Calculation errors while running:

Teaching people to use it
-------------------------

- Build up a worksheet which does something interesting, like playing a game
- Have people fill in formulas one by one
- Check answer
- Some people will never get to events, so do that later - pay for what you use
- In tutorial games, time how long it takes people to answer questions so you know which are the tough ones
- Compare to familiar things eg big expressions vs separate defs -> one long sentence in English vs separate definitions
- You are just saying what things mean, and you need to learn a few words
