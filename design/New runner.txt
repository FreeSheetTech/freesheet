New Runner
==========

- Object with functions
- Functions generated almost directly from FS expressions
- Will still need Operations
- Will still need some of code generator
- Functions reference others via this
- Inputs are stored as a list
- Named values are also functions
- Need to know when to take all values of an input or only latest
- When change a function, need to re-run all inputs
- Need to know which function values have changed
- Rx may still have a place
- Should value changes be notified where still has same value - event stream view?


Possible optimisations
----------------------
- Cache function values
- Work out what functions might be affected by an input
- Memoise functions for certain arguments
- Autogenerate objects with functions attached
- Change full scans to fold operations using only the latest value
