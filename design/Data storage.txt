Data Storage
============

Worksheet document data source
------------------------------
- Docs with embedded worksheets act as data sources
- Maybe select from all in a directory
- Or could be a document on web
- Or a set of documents on web if have directory index
- Would allow invoice docs to be saved and contribute directly to accounts
- Or scanned documents, fill in details below
- Data source should cache and update when docs are added or timestamp updated
- Function defines file location, worksheet name, named values to pick out from worksheet

Adapter functions
-----------------
- Can get data from anywhere if you can write an adapter function for it
- Same-origin rules may mean some things can only be done in a server-side sheet

Storage types
-------------
- Server-side can have a shared store, where every user sees same data, or per-user store, where get own data with same worksheet

Sharing data as worksheet docs
------------------------------
- Example: vocab lists
- Can explain what the list is about in the text document part
- Other users can can read the data but not update it
- As master data updates, see new items, keep own data related to it in own storage
- Useful if docs available with CORS
- Could keep data in various formats, provide simple adapter worksheet in either source or consumer

Data formats for sharing
-----------------------
- Maybe common interface data formats will emerge for various fields
- Get worksheet data as JSON by default? Or as text definition?

Local storage implementation
----------------------------

- Usage: storedStream = localStore(rawStream, "myEvents")
- Stores any events on rawStream under key "freesheet.myEvents"
- Stores in an array, appends new events to end and updates each time a new event arrives
- Starts stream with anything in the local storage on loading the sheet
