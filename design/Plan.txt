Plan

Parts needed
------------
    - Language definition
    - AST data structure definition
    - Text syntax definition
    - Text to AST parser
- AST to stream net builder - different to runner?
    - AST to JS code generator
- Worksheet to AST converter
- Worksheet to AST to stream net live update
- AST to text converter
- AST to worksheet converter
- AST to worksheet live update
- Page to AST converter
    - Stream net runner
- Stream net to template updater
- Error handling mechanism

Next steps
----------
- Parse a whole worksheet as a function, not just individual formulas
- Make the function available for use elsewhere
- Make functions work on streams
- Instantiate multiple copies of the function
- Generate updating monitor display automatically
- Nesting updating displays
- Multiple updating displays for all usages of function
- Data loading functions
- Actions on output events
- Define own functions
- Data tables

Immediate to do
---------------
    - Comparative operators in correct precedence
- Dummy getData
    - Filter function
    - Object expressions
    - Scoping rules - including object expressions
    - Core functions
- Error handling
- Cyclic references
    - Date and time period arithmetic
- Streams stopped when dependents removed - eg now() and map to elapsed
- if and boolean expressions
- simplified references in aggregates
- merge aggregate with + operator
- none for nullÂ 
- worksheet entry/display improvements
- styling in pages
- documentation
- working in elmon

Future steps
------------
- Modularize into library
- Contributions mechanism
- Safe third-party JS
- Server side sheets for API
- Open source but pay for hosting
- Instant play and save
- JSFiddle-like instant worksheet page
- Works in JSFiddle


Stages of usefulness
--------------------

- Worksheet with save/load: demo concept, results visible in worksheet
- Embedded script creating worksheet: show worksheet in web page
- Embedded script with templating: HTML created active web page, compact language, debugging

- ??? : develop script in worksheet and save
- ??? : WYSIWYG page development
