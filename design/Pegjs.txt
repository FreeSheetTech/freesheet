Pegjs Notes
===========

- In function call parsing, each argument parsed adds 300ms - even if just numbers!
- In parsing expression "getTheAnswer(100, b + addOne(a), getTheAnswer ( 4, 10, c)  )", called peg$parsefunctionCallWithArgs 1.5m times
- With --cache on, called it 10 times - still seems a lot, but ok
